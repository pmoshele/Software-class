```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load the data
First, we are going to use read.csv to load gapminder data.
```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
summary(dat)
```

#plot the data
##Setup
We need to load the ggplot package
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
###Plotting

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat,
       mapping =aes(x= year,
                    y= lifeExp,
                    by = country,
                    color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ continent)+
  geom_line() +

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
